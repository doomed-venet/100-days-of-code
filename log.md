# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 25, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Revised the basics of C++. Started reading about STL in C++. Practiced some questions on @hackerrank.

**Thoughts:**First day of the challenge was great!! Tried doing the tasks I assigned myself, and I am satisfied with it. I still have to organize things a bit which I'll surely do from this day onwards.

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:Continued with my revision on C++ and tried a few questions on pointers. Also tried a couple of codes on dictionary in Python.


**Thoughts:**It was a busy day. Yet I was able to complete today's tasks somehow.(Had to miss Der Klassiker for that though :p ). I need to work on my speed and concentration more. Looking forward to tomorrow's tasks.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about tuples in Python; tried doing a couple of problems in it. Also tried doing a few problem on Vectors in C++; Naah! I'm still stuck in it ;( !! 

**Thoughts:**  I can feel the improvement in my ability to sit and code. Struggled with the task today but learned a lot while trying to solve it.

### Day 3: May 28, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried some more problems on tuples in Python;  Carried on with  Vectors in C++.

**Thoughts:**  A very challenging day. Learning how write a program is fine, but solving an problem takes much more than that. Still a lot of work to do, a long way to go.

### Day 4: May 29, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Was stuck on Vectors in C++, the entire evening. 

**Thoughts:**  Totally drained today, and somehow, that's satisfying. Need to be more careful while coding. Silly mistakes are haunting me.

### Day 5: May 30, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried my hands on a few introduction problems on @hackerrank. 
Also, managed to do the problem in vectors that I was stuck on. 


**Thoughts:** Nothing feels better than seeing all test cases being satisfied! Looking forward to tomorrow's challenges.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried the basics of iteration through a CSV file to create dictionaries, and collect summary statistics, without using Pandas.


**Thoughts:** Learning something new everyday is just as satisfying as realizing that you remember what you learned yesterday.

### Day 7: June 1, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about the various functions in NumPy module in Python and tried to implement them for better understanding. 


**Thoughts:** Couldn't code much today. Not satisfied.

### Day 8: June 2, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried several problems on dictionaries and lists in Python. Exception handling, using functions to make an interactive dictionary and iterating through the dictionaries were some of the topic I worked on today.


**Thoughts:** Really glad to see that I haven't forgotten what I learned a few days ago. At the same time I come to realize how important is practice in coding.
