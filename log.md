**Thoughts** : I was unable to code yesterday, and spent my time in theory instead. Will compensate that at the end.

### Day 83: August 17, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Tried writing the cide for percolation problem today. Used unionfind algorithm and found out percolation statistics, percolation probability and eventually determined the percolation threshold .

**Thoughts** : Had to scratch my head for hours to get the code right in Java. Need to exploreit more.

### Day 84: August 18, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Started with Natural language processing today. Learned some basic functions in NLTK and saw some that have  implemented it. Also learned some more about K-means algorithm for clustering. 

**Thoughts** : I wonder if I could do something by implementing clustering as well as NLP?ðŸ¤”

### Day 85: August 19, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Wrote a program that classifies the sentiment of book reviews. Used Natural language Processing techniques to prepare and process texts, for predicting their sentiment.

**Thoughts** : Programs like this can be useful for libraries and book vendorsto predict demand based on user reviews.

### Day 86: August 20, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about web scraping today. Saw how Request and BeautifulSoap modules in python can be used for web crawlers and parsing the data respectively. Did a basic implementation to see how things work. 

**Thoughts** : Planning to use it to get data for the ML algorithms.

### Day 87: August 21, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Softmax function and its use in Softmax Regression for multi-class classification. Used multinomial-softmax regression function to perform a multi-class classification, which I had previously done using one vs rest approach. 

**Thoughts** : Also learned about ensembling methods and will try to use them in my upcoming projects.

### Day 88: August 22, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Naive Bayes  algorithm and used the Bayesian Classifier today for binary classification on a couple of known datasets. 

**Thoughts** : Started with some graphical heuristics, because I am very poor in presenting data  using graphs.

### Day 89: August 23, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Spent the day on MATLAB today. Tried plotting the step and impulse response of 1st and 2nd order systems. Also wrote code to find out the characteristics of the second order system like Settling time, Rise time, Peak overshoot etc.

**Thoughts** : Kinda feels like I'm cheating, but it had coding too so I guess it counts.

### Day 90: August 24, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about PCA and it's implementation in dimensionality deduction. The algorithm is still a mystery to me, but it works fine. Also implemented K-means algorithm for clustering of a given data. 

**Thoughts** : Another weapon added to my arsenal! Btw, I'm into the nervous 90's!

### Day 91: August 25, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to check balanced parentheses, and reversing a string or linked list using stack. Also read about infix, prefix and postfix, and infix to postfix conversion using stack.

**Thoughts** : I hope I'm not too late to learnall these. Need to boost up my speed.

### Day 92: August 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned how to implement PCA using MATLAB. Learned about its working and algorithm used. Computed covariance matrix and eigen vectors  to implement PCA for data compression and visualisation.

**Thoughts** : PCA is such a cool algorithm and the way it compresses data while  maintaining a certain level of variance in the data; really fascinating. Need to be careful not to confuse it with linear regression though.

### Day 93: August 27, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about ensemble methods in machine learning.  Got an understanding on how they work to improve classification, decrease bias and variance , and improve generalization in the model.

**Thoughts** : Tried a few Sklearn ensembling models , namely Bagging, Boosting, Adaboost and XGBoost into known data to see their working.

### Day 94: August 28, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about Anomaly detection today.Used the Gaussian probability density for it. Tried developing and implementing an anomaly detection algorithm and observed it's working.

**Thoughts** : Still have a lot of weakness in the Maths involved, something that can be improved only be revision and  implementation.

### Day 95: August 30, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Working on developing an XGBoost classifier for my upcoming project. So I set up a conda environment, imported the XGBoost library and implemented on a dataset I've worked before. It worked great and gave much higher accuracy.

**Thoughts** : Next, I'll be using it on my project data.

### Day 96: August 31, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Learned about multivariate Gaussian distribution today. Saw how the diagonal  and off-diagonal elements of the covariance matrix affect the distribution, and the effects of changing the mean. Used the multivariate Gaussian distribution to implement anomaly detection.

**Thoughts** : It was a good clarification as to why anomaly detection is different from other supervised learning methods. You may not have any idea what an anomaly looks like, which is not the case with general  classification problems.

### Day 97: September 1, 2020 

**Today's Progress**: Worked on a classification problem using XGBoost library in python. Processed the data, scaled it and performed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

**Thoughts** : With the amount of parameters I've given, legends say its still running.
