# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 25, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Revised the basics of C++. Started reading about STL in C++. Practiced some questions on @hackerrank.

**Thoughts:**First day of the challenge was great!! Tried doing the tasks I assigned myself, and I am satisfied with it. I still have to organize things a bit which I'll surely do from this day onwards.
