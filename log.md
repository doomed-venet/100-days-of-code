### Day 0: May 25, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Revised the basics of C++. Started reading about STL in C++. Practiced some questions on @hackerrank.

**Thoughts:**First day of the challenge was great!! Tried doing the tasks I assigned myself, and I am satisfied with it. I still have to organize things a bit which I'll surely do from this day onwards.

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:Continued with my revision on C++ and tried a few questions on pointers. Also tried a couple of codes on dictionary in Python.


**Thoughts:**It was a busy day. Yet I was able to complete today's tasks somehow.(Had to miss Der Klassiker for that though :p ). I need to work on my speed and concentration more. Looking forward to tomorrow's tasks.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about tuples in Python; tried doing a couple of problems in it. Also tried doing a few problem on Vectors in C++; Naah! I'm still stuck in it ;( !! 

**Thoughts:**  I can feel the improvement in my ability to sit and code. Struggled with the task today but learned a lot while trying to solve it.

### Day 3: May 28, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried some more problems on tuples in Python;  Carried on with  Vectors in C++.

**Thoughts:**  A very challenging day. Learning how write a program is fine, but solving an problem takes much more than that. Still a lot of work to do, a long way to go.

### Day 4: May 29, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Was stuck on Vectors in C++, the entire evening. 

**Thoughts:**  Totally drained today, and somehow, that's satisfying. Need to be more careful while coding. Silly mistakes are haunting me.

### Day 5: May 30, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried my hands on a few introduction problems on @hackerrank. 
Also, managed to do the problem in vectors that I was stuck on. 


**Thoughts:** Nothing feels better than seeing all test cases being satisfied! Looking forward to tomorrow's challenges.

### Day 6: May 31, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried the basics of iteration through a CSV file to create dictionaries, and collect summary statistics, without using Pandas.


**Thoughts:** Learning something new everyday is just as satisfying as realizing that you remember what you learned yesterday.

### Day 7: June 1, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about the various functions in NumPy module in Python and tried to implement them for better understanding. 


**Thoughts:** Couldn't code much today. Not satisfied.


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 8: June 2, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried several problems on dictionaries and lists in Python. Exception handling, using functions to make an interactive dictionary and iterating through the dictionaries were some of the topic I worked on today.


**Thoughts:** Really glad to see that I haven't forgotten what I learned a few days ago. At the same time I come to realize how important is practice in coding.

### Day 9: June 3, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Studied about Series and  Dataframes in Python. Explored OS and CSV modules in python.Wrote some programs using all these.


**Thoughts:** Really enjoyed learning today. Especially working on CSV files; simple and fun. Found this video helpful- https://youtu.be/q5uM4VKywbA . A productive day, indeed!

### Day 10: June 4, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned the basic methods and functions of pandas dataframes  in Python. Implemented them in a few programs in which I tried to access and analyse data in CSV files. 


**Thoughts:**  Could have done more progress today. Need to focus some more!


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 11: June 5, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried some problems on pandas dataframes and series. Optimized a few of my previous programs using psndas. 


**Thoughts:**  Pandas functions and methods are really handy. Reduced the complexity and volume of my programs significantly.

### Day 12: June 6, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Configured my first project specific  conda environment. Planning to start a new beginner level project . Will add it here soon!

**Thoughts:**  After working is chaos for so long, I felt it's time to make things more systematic .


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 13: June 7, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about querying and indexing in Dataframes. Tried a few problems but got very confused and mixed up.  

**Thoughts:**  Learning, forgeting and remembering is the part of the process I guess. Looking forward to tomorrow!


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 14: June 8, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried some problems on querying, indexing  in Dataframes. Cleared most of the doubts I had yesterday and was able to implement them into a couple of datasets. 

**Thoughts:**  Gonna shift gears soon and try more challenging problems.


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 15: June 9, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about merging dataframes . Tried a few problems in it and was able to understand it quite well. 

**Thoughts:**  Couldn't do much progress today, so that's a bit disappointing. The learning streak is on though.


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 16: June 10, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about groupby function in pandas and tried  learn how to write idiomatic pandas codes. Tried a few problems in it but there's still some grey area. 

**Thoughts:**  Not a bad day but couldn't give more time to coding and was stuck with the theoretical stuff mostly.



# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 17: June 11, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Studied about pointers , references,  function pointers, heap memory allocation and dynamic memory allocation. Tried a couple of problems from each of these topics. 

**Thoughts:**  Not much, but I need to be absolutely clear in these fundamentals so it's worth it.


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 18: June 12, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Read about how to access , iterate and edit an excel file in Python. Tried a task of filtering and organizing data in an excel file using pandas and other methods available in Python. 

**Thoughts:**  Turns out that filtering and organizing data is far more tedious than analysing it.



# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 19: June 13, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried  problems on data cleaning today. Basically, used whatever I've learned till now to make  a raw dataset usable for further analysis.  Next, I'll be doing specific problems on this dataset in jupyter notebook.

**Thoughts:** Domain knowledge is very important in data science. Proper understanding of the data makes operating on it a lot easier. 


# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 20: June 14, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Tried  problems on merge and groupby functions today. 
**Thoughts:** Couldn't spend much time on learning today. Didn't feel like it.
