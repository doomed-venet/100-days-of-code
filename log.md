# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 25, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Revised the basics of C++. Started reading about STL in C++. Practiced some questions on @hackerrank.

**Thoughts:**First day of the challenge was great!! Tried doing the tasks I assigned myself, and I am satisfied with it. I still have to organize things a bit which I'll surely do from this day onwards.

### Day 1: May 26, 2020 

**Today's Progress**:Continued with my revision on C++ and tried a few questions on pointers. Also tried a couple of codes on dictionary in Python.


**Thoughts:**It was a busy day. Yet I was able to complete today's tasks somehow.(Had to miss Der Klassiker for that though :p ). I need to work on my speed and concentration more. Looking forward to tomorrow's tasks.

### Day 2: May 27, 2020 


**Today's Progress**: Learned about tuples in Python; tried doing a couple of problems in it. Also tried doing a few problem on Vectors in C++; Naah! I'm still stuck in it ;( !! 

**Thoughts:**  I can feel the improvement in my ability to sit and code. Struggled with the task today but learned a lot while trying to solve it.
